# 1. calculate area of rectangle

# get the length and width of the rectangle from the user
# calculate area of rectangle
# print out area of rectangle

# length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle:"))
# width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle:"))
# area = length*width
# print("The area of the rectangle is:", area) 

# 2.  add two numbers

# Initialize two variables a and b with values 10 and 6
# calculate sum of a and b store the result in new variable called total
# print total value

# a = 10
# b = 6
# total = a + b
# print(total)

# add two numbers with enter the value:

# get the input from the two numbers
# add two numbers and store the variable
# diplay the result

# num1 = int(input("Enter the first number:"))
# num2 = int(input("Enter the second number:"))
# result = num1 + num2
# print("The sum is:", result)
